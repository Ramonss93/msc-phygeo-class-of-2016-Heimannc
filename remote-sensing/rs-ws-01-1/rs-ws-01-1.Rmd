## LiDAR-based intensity range within each raster cell

## Question:

Our digital surface model is processed without using "ground returns". We expect that a digital surface model could also be computed by only using the "first returns" of all classes.

In order to verify that expectations, we computed a difference-raster between a DSM-raster including all returns of class 13, and a DSM-raster including only first returns of all classes.

The image below implies an impression of the hight-differences of both rasters with areas of equal, larger or smaller surface hights.
